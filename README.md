#Flasktool

Flasktool originally was developed in order to provide a path for a  to upload potentially sensitive data directly into Infusionsoft. Since the data could not be on our computers locally, a series the scripts that I normally run and write on the fly, in [dreampie](http://dreampie.org) was merged with Flask(because real GUI is hard) and Flasktool was born.

It should be easy to see that it has its roots firmly based in a tutorial. [This is the repo](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/flasky) that laid the groundwork of this project, so don't be surprised to find large parts of it peeking through, well, everywhere.

That repo accompanies the [Flask Web Development book](http://amzn.com/1449372627). Overall it is a good little book that introduces the basics of Flask to someone familiar with the stuff I call python.

##To do

* add side navigation to allow users to change between functions
* Steal parts of the [Tabbie](https://tabbie.io/) UI, perhaps. Basically, make each little tabbie element a separate process? [Forked Tabbie Source](https://github.com/jeremiahmarks/tabbie)
* Add functionality to do lots of things that are cool and helpful.
